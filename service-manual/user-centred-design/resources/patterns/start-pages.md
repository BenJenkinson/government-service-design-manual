{:.intro}
Start pages are how people access transactions on GOV.UK. All services on GOV.UK must have a start page.


Status: [Research required](#research)


Start pages consist of:

1. the name of the service
2. a short introduction
3. a call to action button
4. any additional information

<div class="example">
  <div class="inner-block">

    <a href="http://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/examples/start-page">
      <img src="/service-manual/assets/images/design-patterns/start-page.png" alt="Example of a start page" />
    </a>

  </div>

# Code

There's a [start page template](http://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/examples/start-page) in the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit).

# Guidance


### 1. Service name

The name of the service should tell people what it lets them do and who it's for.

Avoid acronyms and noun phrases. The best service names start with a verb, like "Pay your car tax".



### 2. Short introduction

If you need to, include a few lines of SEO friendly introductory text.



### 3. Call to action button

This button text should contain a clear call to action to start the service.

If the service is not hosted on GOV.UK then this should be made clear.


### 4. Additional information

Tell people about:

* information or documents they will need to use the service
* anything that will help them decide whether to use the service (eg how much it costs, how long it takes)
* other ways that people can access the service

Thereâ€™s no need to mention something that most users will already know or assume.

Don't try to get across complex eligibility criteria. Instead, deal with these inside the service itself.

# Getting a start page on GOV.UK 

When you're close to your beta launch, [contact the GOV.UK content team](https://support.production.alphagov.co.uk/new_feature_request/new) to ask for a start page.

You should tell them:

+ what the service is and who it's for
+ what user needs it addresses
+ eligibility criteria and restrictions
+ what documents or information the user will need to use the service
+ a preview of the service (if available)
+ other methods of applying eg phone and post
+ a demo URL (with a username and password if necessary)
+ when the service is expected to pass its beta assessment

Factor in time it'll take for the content to be written and fact-checked -
the start page can only be published after both:

+ the service passes its [beta assessment](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/phases/beta.html) or self-certification
+ the service goes live

# Research

You can help improve this pattern by researching the following:

- how effective is the copy below the green button?
- what are the most important eligibility requirements to state up front?
- how should start pages be positioned with regards to related guidance?
