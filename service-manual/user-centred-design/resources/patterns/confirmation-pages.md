{:.intro}
A confirmation page lets someone know theyâ€™ve completed a transaction and explains to them what will happen next.

<div class="example">
  <a href="http://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/examples/confirmation-page">
    <img src="/service-manual/assets/images/design-patterns/confirmation-page.png" alt="An example of a confirmation page">
  </a>
</div>

<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-1">Guidance</h2>

The page should include:

* a reference number (if there is one)
* details of what happens next and when
* contact details for the service
* links to related information and services
* a prompt to give [feedback](/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/feedback-pages) on the service
* a way of saving a record of the transaction (eg as a PDF)


<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-2">Implementation</h2>

An example [confirmation page template](http://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/examples/confirmation) is now available in the [GOV.UK Prototyping Kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit).

Some users might bookmark confirmation pages as a form of receipt. Make sure your service responds in a helpful way when they return to the page.


<h2 class="heading-36" id="section-3">Research required</h2>

The following areas require further research:

* Where further action is required by the users, should this pattern be used?
* If so, how do we ensure people are aware of those actions?
* If not, what pattern should be used?

Help improve this pattern by sharing relevant examples or research on the [GOV.UK design patterns wiki](https://designpatterns.hackpad.com/Transaction-end-pages-xkOPGx6R1iM).
